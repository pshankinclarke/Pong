This project replicates Pong, the table tennisâ€“themed arcade video game originally released by Atari in 1972. The theme for this game is singles tennis played between two indivduals, where the object of the game is to score 10 points (win by 2). The mechanics of the game are identical to the original Pong video game. That is, the game consists of two paddles and one ball. The game is single player, where one user controls a single paddle and is playing against an AI  with three different levels of difficulty (easy, medium, and hard).
